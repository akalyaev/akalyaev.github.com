I am an enthusiastic developer, who likes to grow every day in different areas
of expertise and apply that knowledge in everyday life.

I also read a lot of books! You can follow my reviews on

My open source work is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/melekes/), my
talks are on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/melekes), my work history
is on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/melekes), and my thoughts are
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/akaliaev). Youâ€™re also welcome to say
