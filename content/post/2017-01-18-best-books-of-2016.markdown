Wanted to share the best books I've read in 2016.

<!--more-->

Although few of the books were simply ridiculous and senseless, the majority
fulfilled my hopes. To weed out crap, I read reviews on [Goodreads]
(https://www.goodreads.com), [Ozon.ru] (https://www.ozon.ru), [Litres]
(https://www.litres.ru). *Know something else worth doing?*

However, on Goodreads sometimes a book's top comment has only 1 star and 555
likes (read "this book is a complete disaster, DO NOT READ"). But when you read
it, you like it so much you could barely take a break. But that happens rarely.
Average rating is quite adequate.

### Nonfiction

[Einstein: His Life and Universe by Walter Isaacson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10884.Einstein)

{{< figure src="/images/posts/2017-01-18-best-books-of-2016/einstein.jpg" title="Einstein: His Life and Universe by Walter Isaacson" >}}

My review:

Excellent written biography of the remarkable man! I think the author really
managed to understand Einstein. Not sure I fully understood the general theory
of relativity. Although, the basics are written using a very simple language. I
took many notes from the book.

[Letters from a Stoic by Seneca, Robin Campbell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97411.Letters_from_a_Stoic)

{{< figure src="/images/posts/2017-01-18-best-books-of-2016/seneca.jpg" title="Letters from a Stoic by Seneca, Robin Campbell" >}}

My review:

Liked it very much. I think I just became a fan of stoicism.

[Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow)

{{< figure src="/images/posts/2017-01-18-best-books-of-2016/flow.jpg" title="Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi" >}}

My review:

A must-read book. I would like to read it in my eighteens. Now, when I am 27, I
haven't learned much from this book. On TED the author only gives the basic
idea: the connection of happiness and flow. In the book, this topic is covered
in greater detail and many life examples are given.

### Business

[Бизнес как игра by Сергей Абдульманов, Дмитрий Борисов, Дмитрий Кибкало](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28437799)

{{< figure src="/images/posts/2017-01-18-best-books-of-2016/business_like_a_game.jpg" title="Бизнес как игра by Сергей Абдульманов, Дмитрий Борисов, Дмитрий Кибкало" >}}

Мой отзыв:

Без воды, с юмором, дельными советами и жизненными историями.

There are no other editions, except Russian. Sorry, English reading folks.

### Programming

[Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks: When Threads Unravel by Paul Butcher](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18467564-seven-concurrency-models-in-seven-weeks)

{{< figure src="/images/posts/2017-01-18-best-books-of-2016/7models7weeks.jpg" title="Seven Concurrency Models in Seven Weeks: When Threads Unravel by Paul Butcher" >}}

My review:

Another must-read to expand the horizons.
