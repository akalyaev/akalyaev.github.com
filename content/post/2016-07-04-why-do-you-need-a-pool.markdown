There are a number of reasons you may want to use a pool of workers in your application.

<!--more-->

**1) Distribute work across all available CPUs.**

For that, we create fixed number of threads with the desired level of
parallelism = the number of available cores of the host's CPU. *Example in
Java.*

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
```

This may require some tuning. A number of threads could be increased or
decreased. Alternately, you could switch to
[WorkStealingPool](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html#newWorkStealingPool--)
if fork/join model better suits your needs. Refer to
  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executors.html
  for more information.

**2) Open N connections to an external resource (typically, a database)**

This gives us a lot of benefits (some of them are not so obvious):

- we do not spend time on opening the connections (if we're creating a TCP connection, handshake could take [up to 750 ms](https://www.quora.com/How-long-does-tcp-connection-setup-time-take-on-average))
- it is much easier to support the code since all operations with the particular resource happen in one place
- it is much easier to analyze the current application's state (number of connections, etc.)
- we improve throughput by sharing the network latency

I think, only the last one requires explanation, others are pretty obvious.

Our friend Barney here wants to buy some beer, so he takes a long walk to the nearest store. It will take him `3 * (t1 + t2)` to buy 3 beers.

t1 is a network latency, t2 - processing time.

What if instead, he and his buddies will go to the store together. **Even if the store has only one cash register (like Redis) and the cashier serve them in turn, they will buy 3 beers in `t1 + 3 * t2`**.

Most often t1 much greater than t2. Therefore, `t1 + 3 * t2` < `3 * (t1 + t2)`.
In other words, it is better to send N requests in parallel comparing to
sending one by one because the network latency is greater than time to process
a request.
