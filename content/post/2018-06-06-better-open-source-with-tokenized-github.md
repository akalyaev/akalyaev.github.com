In the light of the recent news, I wanted to share an idea I had just recently.

Every popular open-source project on Github eventually becomes overwhelmed by
the number of issues. That's because it's so easy to create one. You are not
required to understand the project. You are not required to read the
documentation. All you need is a Github account.

And this is an example of the amplification attack. By the very essence, the
number of people maintaining the project is much much less than the number of
people using it. Plus, very often, maintainer's time costs more than time of a
person who created an issue (e.g. a person, who's new to crypto, trying to
write his first smart-contract). Again, there is no protection against this
kind of behaviour.

There are some ways companies seem to have adopted over time:

1. Ignore the issue and close it after some inactivity period (Google).
2. Spend your valuable time on every issue (Ruby on Rails issue team).
3. Ban specific users

Yet there is a new idea circulating around crypto sphere. Why don't introduce
crypto-economics into open-source?

Suppose user A wants to create an issue. She pays X tokens to create it. The
maintainers review it, and if they think it's valuable, user A gets her tokens
back plus some bonus maybe (if the issue uncovers a huge bug).

And it can't be done as a Chrome plugin (opposite to
[Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)). It needs to be hard-coded into the platform.

Maybe that's what [oscoin](http://oscoin.io/) is planning to do. I don't know.
Not sure if we need decentralised Github, at least in it's open-source part.
But it's possible people will switch to such platform because their private
repositories will be there.

But I am convinced we deserve better Github for open-source projects.
