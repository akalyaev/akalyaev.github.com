If you haven't heard, [Curry On](http://curry-on.org/) is a new conference
(first time this year), which took place in Prague earlier in July. Despite its
age, many good speakers happened to be there. Here is the list of my favorite
talks. _Disclaimer: your experience may vary._

This is my fantastic four. However, I also enjoyed [the talk][1] about
dependent types in Idris, [tips for VM writers][2] and [user-focused design in
Elm][3].
