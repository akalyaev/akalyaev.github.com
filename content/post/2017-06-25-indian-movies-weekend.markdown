On my way from Berlin to Warsaw I've met 2 really cool guys from India - Winny
and Raghav. They asked me to recommend 3 Russian movies to them and I did. Then
I asked to return a favor. I watched all of them and they are amazing. No
wonder they all have a very good score on IMDB. So, thank you guys!
