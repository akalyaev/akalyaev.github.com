On the contrary to [Indian
movies](http://homeonrails.com/2017/06/indian-movies-weekend/), Brazilian
movies are full of pain, struggle, and tears. These movies deeply reflect the
history of their country, uncovering all the problems which exist even upon
today. They were recommended to me by an architect from Brazil I've met in
Lithuania.
