This is a monthly "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most
last month. Whether it was a full length movie, short film, music album, book
or even a painting.

**What I am reading**

* Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow (2015)

{{< youtube id="93N2MH7PE6k" >}}

* [Official site](http://www.ynharari.com/book/homo-deus/)
* [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464310)
* [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31138556-homo-deus)
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_Deus:_A_Brief_History_of_Tomorrow)

Ever since I've read Yuval Noah Harari's first book, Sapiens: A Brief History
of Humankind, I became a fan of his work. I started reading Homo Deus: A Brief
History of Tomorrow a few days ago and it is incredible.

* [The keto diet, explained](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/2/21/16965122/keto-diet-reset)

50% of my coworkers are on keto. Maybe it's another passing trend, and they
will be on a different diet next year. We'll see.

**What I am watching**

* Altered Carbon (2018)

{{< youtube id="dhFM8akm9a4" >}}

* [WikipediA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_Carbon_(TV_series))
* [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2261227/)
* [Kinopoisk.ru](https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/vidoizmenennyy-uglerod-2018-669089/)

Former separatist brought back to life to solve a murder case. I like these
attempts to guess how the future of humanity will look like. AI friends gather
to play poker; police is using a VR for interrogation purposes.

* Spartan Up 155: Itâ€™s All About Your Desires says Angel List Founder Naval Ravikant

{{< youtube id="X7tnoR6a-8A" >}}

One of the modern thinkers I am closely following.

* Nerdwriter: The Most Disturbing Painting

{{< youtube id="g15-lvmIrcg" >}}

If you, like me, hardly understand art, this video and other similar episodes
will allow you to get a deeper understanding of the work of the artists of the
brush.
