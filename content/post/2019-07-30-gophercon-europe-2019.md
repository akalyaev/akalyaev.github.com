Videos from GopherCon Europe 2019 are up. Shoot out for organizers for sharing
them! As usual, I am publishing the talks, which I liked the most. Hope you'll
enjoy these too.

### 1. Ivan Daniluk - Rethinking Visual Programming

{{< youtube id="Ps3mBPcjySE" >}}

This talk is based on ["Rethinking Visual Programming with
Go"](https://divan.dev/posts/visual_programming_go/), which I highly recommend
you to read. You can actually drop the video completely if you've read the
article.

### 2. Egon Elbre - Psychology of Code Readability
