This is a monthly "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most
last month. Whether it was a full length movie, short film, music album or
book or even painting.

A little bit about motivation behind this. I decided to start these series,
because there is more I want share besides the "tech stuff". Again, it's more
like an experiment, so let me know if I should continue or not.

## Film - Dogville (2003)

An unusual movie, although simple in its essence. The astonishing work of Lars
Von Trier, whom I became a fan.

The guy is wandering the city with a camera strapped to his head. 24 hours of material in roughly 2 minutes. Outstanding cut!
