A few days ago I was invited to be a guest on the ["Basic
Block"](https://basicblockradio.com/) podcast. In spite of me writing a note on
what I'm going to say & key points, which you can read
[here](./2019-04-10-on-tendermint-and-cosmos-ru.md), I sucked at it. Or at
least, that's how I felt after doing it.

Talking in public is not new to me, but giving a speech is different from a
podcast. In the former case, questions are usually asked in the end of the
presentation. Here you have a dialog and expected to answer within a second no
matter how difficult the question is. I.e. you don't have time to think. I
thought I'd share some lessons learned:

### 1) Have a coherent self story

TODO

### 2) Do not mix high & low-level details

TODO

### 3) Prepare answers for frequent questions

TODO

### 4)
