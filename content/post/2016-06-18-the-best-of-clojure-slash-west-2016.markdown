I've recently decided to give Clojure another try and, as a part of my
wanderings, watched talks from Clojure/west 2016. Clojure/west is the biggest
Clojure conference in the western United States and all about this language, as
you may guess.

As usual, I am publishing the talks, which I liked the most. Hope you'll enjoy
these too. _Disclaimer: your experience may vary._

# 1. Managing One of the World's Largest Clojure Code Bases

by Donevan Dolby (41 min)

Never would have thought that Clojure could be a part of an airplane's software (Boeing 737 Max).

# 2. Parallel Programming, Fork Join, and Reducers

by Daniel Higginbotham (41 min)

Daniel is an author of "Clojure for the brave and true". He talks about
approaches to parallel programming (thread management, task decomposition) and
fork/join framework. He is also fun to watch, so go watch it right now.

# 3. Types are like the Weather, Type Systems are like Weathermen

by Matthias Felleisen (1 hour 15 min)

Types for untyped languages:

- must speak the grown idioms
- must allow gradual additions
- ought to come with soundness because
  * it reduces developer time
  * it won't mask errors (like Typed Clojure does)

# 4. One Million Clicks per Minute with Kafka and Clojure

by Devon Peticolas (31 min)

I like talks where you see the gradual improvement of the code (Kafka's consumer in this case).

Devon finishes his talk with the thought that **Clojure could potentially
become the main language for stream processing applications** and solutions
([Onyx](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx)), because of it's Java interop
and Lisp's expressiveness. What do you think?
