If you still don't know, Lingualeo and The British Council are conducting a
[contest](http://education.lingualeo.com/) from Jan 25 to Feb 8.

Here is my submission:

I was always fascinated by the future of humanity. People, who live for a very
long time and almost never get sick. People, who close to death, transforming
their brain into digital form and existing on the net, or in the body of the
robot. People, who travel across the galaxy, exploring new planets and
horizons. People, who appreciate life and exist in harmony with nature.

Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool - one of the
groups, who are investigating the aging process. Take for example their work of
2015 ("Insights into the evolution of longevity from the bowhead whale
genome."), where they mapped the genome for the bowhead whale and discovered
unique genes behind its longevity (more than 200 years): the ERCC1 gene, which
is believed to repair DNA, increase cancer resistance and slow ageing, and the
PCNA gene, which is also linked to DNA repair.

Or their recent work, "Systematic analysis of the gerontome reveals links
between aging and age-related diseases.", which shows the relationship between
aging and age-related diseases (ARDs). In short, human aging-related genes
showed a considerable overlap with ARDs.

In the future, when genetic modification at birth will become the standard de
facto, the contribution of this institute and their colleagues from the USA,
Germany, Portugal and other countries will prove invaluable. Changing or adding
a pair of genes will result in people who live longer, do not have hereditary
diseases and consequently, live a happy and a joyful life.

With all that said, I want to say thank you to all the scientists behind those
works. You are awesome!
