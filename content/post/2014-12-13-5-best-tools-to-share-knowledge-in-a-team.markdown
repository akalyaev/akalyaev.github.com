title: 5 Great Tools To Share Knowledge In a Team
slug: 5-best-tools-to-share-knowledge-in-a-team
---

Sharing knowledge in a team is one of the important factors of success of all
its members and the company as a whole. What it can be? Any sorts of things:
articles, videos, slides, thoughts on a particular tool - generally, any piece
of useful information that you would like to share with your colleagues.

And that's why it's important:

1. Each member of the team is **growing** as a professional;
2. You **communicate** with each other (this is especially important for
   distributed teams);
3. The senior colleagues share their **experience** with the younger ones (by
   posting links to useful books or other materials and discussing certain
   decisions they've made in comments).

Specially for you guys, I picked the 5 best tools to help you put your team
back on track.

## 1. Yammer

</a>

Perhaps the most popular solution on the market, which is used by well-known
companies including eBay, Xerox and Sharp. This is a real corporate network
with groups (both public and private), ability to create events and conduct
polls. It is perfect for sharing knowledge. For those who do not want to go to
the site itself, there is a weekly newsletter. Some do not like its appearance.
Well, there are other options.

**Price**: free for basic usage  <br />
**Platforms**: Web, iOS, Android, Windows Phone  <br />

## 2. Send To Inc

</a>

A great tool for sharing links, notes and files. Groups, easy addition of
resources, robust search, and opportunity to discuss - almost everything you need
for knowledge sharing is in the Send To Inc.

Among the distinctive features worth mentioning integration with such services
as Flowdock, Hipchat, Evernote, Basecamp, opportunity to respond to comments
via email and markdown support. The only thing that upsets - it is impossible
to change the activity digest schedule (either once a day, or none).

**Price**: free for 3 users (other plans starting from $19/mo)  <br />
**Platforms**: Web, Mac OS X  <br />

</a>

If you are looking for something really simple and self-hosted, then you might
like the following app - https://github.com/maccman/monocle. It have a
minimalistic interface - news on the left, and the current article and its
discussion on the right.

**Platforms**: Web only  <br />

## 4. Discourse

</a>

Discourse - powerful forum with many features, including real time notification,
wiki-pages, suggested topics and others. Better yet, it is 100% open-source.
You can setup it on your server or buy a cloud version (though it seems to
me quite expensive). Using wiki pages feature, you can for example create a
knowledge base, which will be used to store **must read** resources.

**Price**: free if self-hosted / monthly-paid (starting from $200/mo) if
cloud-hosted  <br />
**Platforms**: Web only  <br />
**Link**: <a href="http://www.discourse.org/" target="_blank">Site</a>

## 5. Google+ Private Community

<a href="https://plus.google.com" target="_blank">
  <img class="img-rounded" src="/images/posts/2014-12-13-5-best-tools-to-share-knowledge-in-a-team/google-plus-logo.png" alt="Google+ Private Community"/ width="100%" title="Google+ Private Community">
</a>

If you're already using Google+, a private community may satisfy your needs.
Yes, it is only one group and one feed, but nice interface, applications for
all popular platforms and most of the features discussed above may induce many.
I especially liked the auto tagging feature - when you post an article, Google
sets the tags for you. This allow you to categorize information and find it
quickly in the future.

The same can be applied to Facebook.

**Price**: free  <br />
**Platforms**: Web, iOS, Android  <br />
**Link**: <a href="https://plus.google.com" target="_blank">Site</a>
