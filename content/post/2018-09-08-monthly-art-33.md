or even a painting.

**What I am watching**

* One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)

I mostly wanted to watch this movie to compare it with the book. It's very good
adaptation directed by Milos Forman, who later did Amadeus (1984). The film won
Oscars in the five most important categories: Best Director, Best Actor, Best
Actress, Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay. One of only three films in
history to do so (alongside It Happened One Night and The Silence of the
Lambs), it firmly established Forman's reputation.

"... a small dawn light simulator that emits gradual light to replicate the
natural circadian process of sunrise. In an ideal world every athlete would
combine one of those with black-out curtains, temperature control and clean
air."

Recommended temperature for sleep is 16C-18C.

  * lower resting heart rate is better (60-100 is fine)
  * 200-300 minutes of moderate to vigorous active minutes a week will make your heart stronger
  * That sweet spot is not 8 hours of sleep a night - its 7.25 hours
