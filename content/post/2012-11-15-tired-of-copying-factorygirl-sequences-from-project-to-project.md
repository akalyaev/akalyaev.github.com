Take a look at the [factory_girl_sequences](http://rubygems.org/gems/factory_girl_sequences) gem, which provides a basic set of the most common sequences.

In simple projects without a complex business logic, you just need a set of
simple sequences to generate fake data. This can be a login, password or IP address.
The idea to write this mini gem came to me when I, again, was looking for a
sequence to generate the IP address. Of course, I could write it from scratch, but I'm a bit lazy :)

In any case, check out the [project page on GitHub](http://git.io/b99NKA).
