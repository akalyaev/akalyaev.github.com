Read 55 books this year. The shortest book was "If You Can" by William J.
Bernstein, the longest - "The Snowball" by Alice Schroeder. Reread the all time
great "Dune" by Frank Herbert and two Yuval Noah Harari books. There were three
photography books: "Wall and Piece" by Banksy, "Ara GÃ¼ler's Istanbul" and
"Icons of Men's Style" by Josh Sims.

Here are my top 5 favorite books of 2019:

- [Educated by Tara Westover](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35133922-educated)

  The book reminded me of Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood
  by Trevor Noah, which takes you on a journey to South Africa at the time of
  apartheid. This book does the same, but opens another window, through which
  you can see the live of a mormon family (although very radical one).
  I'd recommend the audio version.

- [Awareness: A de Mello Spirituality Conference in His Own Words by Anthony de Mello](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/94318.Awareness)

  I guess this book really stands out for its contrary point of view. I had
  quite a few AHA moments while reading it.

  > This is one of the more personally challenging books I've ever read. It
  made me think... hard. I wanted to sit down and argue with this guy. I didn't
  like how it was written. I didn't like what he said about people and
  selfishness and being and love, but I can't stop thinking about it. The more
  time passes, the more I think thiss asshole is on to something. The Pope must
  have thoght so too, since he EXCOMMUNICATED HIM FOR WRITING IT.

- [Wall and Piece by Banksy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51250.Wall_and_Piece)

  For all the Banksy fans out there. Loved the photos and the small text intro
  telling his position on advertisement and governments.

- [Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World by Cal Newport](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work)

  Living in the era of the information abundance, it's becoming increasingly
  hard to focus. I too feel it. Sometimes you don't even notice the moment you
  go to Twitter/Facebook/Instagram/etc. But in most areas, you do need to focus
  on a job at hand (unless your job is multitasking). This book explains both
  why and how to archive deep focus.

- [Never Split the Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It by Chris Voss](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26156469-never-split-the-difference)

  A handful of techniques from a past FBI international lead hostage negotiator.

You can find all the other books as well as some statistics on
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2019/24729949).
