This is a monthly "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most

or even a painting.

## Movie - Mr. Church (2016)

That's the tough one. I can't say this movie has some particular subject.
Instead, I think, it teaches you many small things like passion, love, life and
death.

One must reason from fundamental truths, rather than by analogy.

## Documentary - Propaganda (2012)

{{< youtube id="hQLfkhwkEbo" >}}

[На русском](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFO0PcHHMA)

The film tells about propaganda, which is used to turn one part of society into powerless and foolish consumers, the other - to slave labor, and the third - to nothing. All for the sake of extracting super-profits for the elite.
