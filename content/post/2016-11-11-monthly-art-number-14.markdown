That's the tough one. I can't say this movie has some particular subject.
Instead, I think, it teaches you many small things like passion, love, life and
death.

[На русском](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLFO0PcHHMA)

The film tells about propaganda, which is used to turn one part of society into powerless and foolish consumers, the other - to slave labor, and the third - to nothing. All for the sake of extracting super-profits for the elite.
