**Articles**

* [Working remotely, 4 years in](https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/02/18/working-remotely--4-years-in/)
  I would recommend every remote dev to read this. Lot's of good advices.

* [The art of the error message](https://thestyleofelements.org/the-art-of-the-error-message-9f878d0bff80)
  Short, but helpful reminder on the importance of good error messages.

* [How to Run Inclusive Meetings](https://thisisfranklin.com/2018/02/22/how-to-run-inclusive-meetings.html)
  Worth reading if you're running a meeting.

**Videos**

* [On Writing Software (well?) #1: Pilot Episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5i1gdwe1Ls)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H5i1gdwe1Ls" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The first episode is about naming and it's great. Others are Rails specific, so
watch them only if you're a Rails developer.

* [Elastic Data Analytics Platform @Datadog](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/datadog-cloud)

Doug Daniels discusses the cloud-based platform they have built at DataDog and
how it differs from a traditional datacenter-based analytics stack. He walks
through the decisions they have made at each layer, covers the pros and cons of
these decisions and discusses the tooling they have built.
