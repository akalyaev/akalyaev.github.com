[Strange Loop](http://www.thestrangeloop.com/) is one of my top 5 most beloved
conferences. You can find all the 63 videos [on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcGKfGEEONaDvuLDFFKRfzbsaBuVVXdYa).
Again, thank you to organizers for sharing them. I think, I have found real
gems for you guys. _Disclaimer: your experience may vary._

There is a nice intro to data processing systems - ["Deep dive into
Unbounded Data Processing Systems" by Monal
Daxini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaxBY-e9ZSg). Apparently, Netflix is
switching from their own custom solution, which uses Kafka and Samza, to Flink
and thinking about Apache Beam.

If you are writing distributed task scheduler, watch ["Building a Distributed
Task Scheduler With Akka, Kafka, and Cassandra" by David van
Geest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3GfXTnzG_Y).

If you want to know how Golang detect data races (hint: using vector clocks),
take a look at [""go test -race" Under the Hood" by Kavya
Joshi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5erqWdlhQLA).
