This is a monthly "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most
last month. Whether it was a full length movie, short film, music album, book
or even a painting.

**What I am reading**

* Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond (2017)

I discovered the best investing bits of advice here (note that I haven't read Benjamin Graham's The Intelligent Investor yet).

  * [Official site](https://www.bitcoinandbeyond.com/)
  * [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cryptoassets-Innovative-Investors-Bitcoin-Beyond-ebook/dp/B0743MPV9R)
  * [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36197082-cryptoassets)

* [19 Great Truths My Grandmother Told Me on Her 90th Birthday](http://www.marcandangel.com/2018/03/25/19-great-truths-my-grandmother-told-me-on-her-90th-birthday/)

It is good to remind yourself of what's important once in a while. It's so easy to get distracted in the modern world.

* [How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You)](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html)

Another long read from one of my favorite authors.

In short, you do a deep self-analysis and find out what you want, then sort (according to priority), then you find the intersection between what you want and what the market offers, set clear goals and buckle down.

But I strongly recommend you to read this article, especially if you're still not sure about your career.

**What I am watching**

* Faces Places (2017)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2rKZcAiLHlY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A very light, inspirational documentary about 2 friends trying to bring more smiles to this world through photography.

  * [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faces_Places_(film))
  * [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5598102/)
