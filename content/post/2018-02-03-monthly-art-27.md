This is a monthly "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most

**What I am reading**

* [Diversification (aka How To Survive A Crash)](https://avc.com/2017/09/diversification-aka-how-to-survive-a-crash/)

"I was emailing with my friend Harry this past week and we started talking
about crypto and the inevitability of a massive crash. I am certain the big
crash will happen. I don’t know when it will happen and I think it may be some
time before it does. But better safe than sorry. So I’m going to write some
thoughts about how to survive it."

* [Driverless Hotel Rooms: The End of Uber, Airbnb and Human Landlords](https://hackernoon.com/driverless-hotel-rooms-the-end-of-uber-airbnb-and-human-landlords-e39f92cf16e1)
