This is a monthly "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most

or even a painting.

**What I am watching**

* The Barkley Marathons: The Race That Eats Its Young (2014)

"In its first 25 years only 10 people have finished The Barkley Marathons.
Based on a historic prison escape, this cult like race tempts people from
around the world to test their limits of physical and mental endurance in this
documentary that contemplates the value of pain."

* [Humane: A New Agenda for Tech](https://humanetech.com/newagenda/)

"CHT offers a diagnosis for the many problems generated by the extractive
attention economy as well as a new path forward for producing technology that
is aligned with humanity."

* (RU) How to find some food in the Moscow trash? Freeganism in Russia

"Freeganism is a practice and ideology of limited participation in the
conventional economy and minimal consumption of resources, particularly through
recovering wasted goods like food".

I like this ideology for three reasons: (1) it brings your attention to
consumerism problem and advocates for rational consumption (2) practice
includes recovering food, which otherwise goes to garbage dumps (3) food is
free!

In Russia, most of the expired food, along with other waste, end up in garbage
dumps [1](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B8%D1%81_%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B8_(2018-2019)).

**What I am reading**

* [Consumerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerism)

I've been thinking about consumption quite a lot recently. This includes what
Yuval Noah Harari calls "romantic consumerism" (~ traveling). The results are
scarse at this point, but a) me and my dad built a composter b) I am trying to
use less paper c) stopped reading FB/Instagram. Future ideas: a) learn how to
sail and live on a boat b) solar panels for my house?

* [Rick and Morty and the Meaning of Life](https://hackernoon.com/rick-and-morty-and-the-meaning-of-life-6640df17e263)

Rick and Morty is one of my favorite series. Daniel Jeffries (the author) made
a sweat mix of ideas/excerpts from the sitcom related to the meaning of life.
Remember that episode with the robot who passes the butter? :)

I'd say this is a funny article, which tries to be smart/deep. I've enjoyed it
utterly nonetheless!
