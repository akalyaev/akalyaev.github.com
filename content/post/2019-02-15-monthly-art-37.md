This is a monthly "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most

or even a painting.

  * [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120731/)

From Giuseppe Tornatore, director of the [Cinema
Paradiso](./2018/11/monthly-art-35.html), The Legend of 1900 tells a story of a
man who was born on a ship and never stood on the land.

Another amazing work from Evan Puschak (@thenerdwriter). I've shared a lot of
his videos here, so people who are interested should be subscribed already. But
how can I not include this :)

* (RU) Тибет: люди-инопланетяне, кочевники, автостоп и как я потерялся в степи

**What I am reading**

* [Kinky Labor Supply and the Attention Tax](https://kortina.nyc/essays/kinky-labor-supply-and-the-attention-tax/)

"Over the past few decades, labor force participation has sharply dropped for
men ages 20-34. Theories about the root cause range from indolence, to a lack
of skills and training, to offshoring, to (perhaps most interestingly) the
increasing attractiveness and availability of leisure and media entertainment.
In this essay, we propose that the drop in labor participation rate of young
men is a result of a combination of factors: (i) a decrease in cost of access
to media entertainment leisure, (ii) increases in both the availability and
(iii) quality media entertainment leisure, and (iv) a decrease in the marginal
signalling utility of (conspicuous) consumption goods for all but the highest
earners."

* [Podcast notes](https://podcastnotes.org/)

At some point I had so many podcasts in my playlist, it became hard to keep up.
I started to look for possible solutions. One of them was deleting some
podcasts/episodes obviously. But I think I've found a better one -
https://podcastnotes.org/. Notes of my favorite podcast episodes (Tim Ferris,
Kevin Rose, Joe Rogan, Rhonda Patrick, ...), in a nice digestible form (I love
"Key Takeaways" section). Alleluia!
