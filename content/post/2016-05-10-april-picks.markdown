### Articles

* [Gentle Introduction to Lockless Concurrency](http://coffeenco.de/articles/lockless_concurrency.html)
  If you, like me, struggle with the term "lock-free" and want to know and explore the subject - this might come in handy.

* [Being A Developer After 40](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/being-a-developer-after-40-3c5dd112210c#.8myi69h2i)
  [ru-RU](https://habrahabr.ru/post/282674/)
  "Hi everyone, I am a forty-two years old self-taught developer, and this is my story." And people love stories.

* [Elixir RAM and the Template of Doom](http://www.evanmiller.org/elixir-ram-and-the-template-of-doom.html)
  Hint: Erlang also does these optimizations since both Erlang and Elixir use the same virtual machine.

* [The Blessing of Interactive Development](http://tonsky.me/blog/interactive-development/)
  "I like to reflect on how my own writing process has evolved over the years." If you want to know how Clojure developers write their code, take a look at this article (and watch video at the end).

### Videos

* [Simplicity is Complicated by Rob Pike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFejpH_tAHM)
  I've probably watched this talk 3 times :) It's worth of your time, trust me.

### Tools

* [Xi Editor](https://github.com/google/xi-editor)
  A modern editor with a backend written in Rust. Powered by Google. Very early stage, though.

* [Your programming copilot](https://kite.com/)
  "Kite augments your coding environment with all the internet’s programming knowledge." Can't wait to try it! So, if you have one extra invitation, please contact me.
