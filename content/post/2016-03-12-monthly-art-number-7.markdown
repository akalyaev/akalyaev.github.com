Historians seem to agree that most of the books of Library of Alexandria were
lost during Caesar's fire and, later, during the taking of the city by another
Roman Emperor, Aurelius. The rest were lost in the conflict between pagans and
christians. This movie shows how religion can be used for evil, killing
thousands of people just because they profess a different religion.

Clothing, which sits perfectly. Houses, which are made of natural materials and
fit perfectly into the surrounding countryside. I would like to live in that
future and I am glad that there are people working on it.
