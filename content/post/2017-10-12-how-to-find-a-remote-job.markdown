+++

Many of you probably know that for the last 10 months I've been working
remotely at [Tendermint](tendermint.com). A few days ago a friend of mine asked
me to give him some practical tips on how to find a remote job (_being a
software developer_). I've told him that it's not so different from searching
for a desk job. However, I did give him a few recommendations that I wanted to
  share with you guys.

### 1. Learn a language

In most cases, it is English, which I think is the most widespread language in
the world. But it could be German or Spanish, depending on the country. Your
English does not have to be perfect, just enough to pass the interview and for
daily communication (Slack, emails, Github, maybe Skype calls once in a while).

### 2. Write a resume

One or two pages are usually enough. You'll need to write your contact details,
work history, and education. Other sections like "Skills" or "Hobbies" are
optional.

A few basic rules:

- no age, sex or religion
- if you have any gaps, please tell what you were doing (even if you were surfing on Bali ;D)

Resume examples: [1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8m3kzttv36vpcnp/Resume.pdf?dl=0). TODO add more.

One thing I noticed just recently - candidates, who have the "Highlights"
section have a higher chance of catching an interviewer's attention. Do you
have any contributions to the language you are using? Or stdlib? Maybe you won
some contest in the past or maintaining a popular open-source project? This is
how it might look like:

```
Highlights:
- contributor to Go language (https://github.com/golang/go/commits?author=XXX)
- Maintains Magic Wand tool (https://github.com/XXX/YYY)
```

### 3. Invest in your resume

If you want to increase chances of being hired, my advice would be to invest
some of your free time and do something (see some ideas above). By something I
mean something you can add to the "Highlights" section or the "Projects"
section.

### 4. Github

Do you have a Github account? Of course, you do, everybody does! Do you have
some repositories in it? And I am not talking about forks. No? Well, my advice
would be to go and write something. Some ideas:

- implement some search algorithm in Rust (why Rust? because it's cool!)
- read the [Seven Concurrency Models in Seven
  Weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/pb7con/seven-concurrency-models-in-seven-weeks)
  by Paul Butcher and solve the [Dining philosophers
  problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem).
- pick something from [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)
- write your own editor http://antirez.com/news/108
- write your own interpreter https://interpreterbook.com/
- write your own OS https://os.phil-opp.com/
- write your own shell https://github.com/kamalmarhubi/shell-workshop

### 5. Practice your pitch

Almost on every interview, you will be asked to tell a little bit about
yourself (pitch). It's a very good idea to write it and practice telling it to
your friend or in front of a mirror.

### 6. Find a job

Here is the list I was using the last time:
