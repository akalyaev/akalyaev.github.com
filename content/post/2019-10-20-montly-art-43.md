This is a monthly "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most

or even a painting.

**What I am watching**

* The Biggest Little Farm (2019)

I began watching this movie with the expectation that it will be mostly
about farming, but it turned out to be much more than that. This movie is about
pursuing your life dreams, compassion, nature & life balance. It's full of
love, joy, sorrow and laughter. Muy recomendado

**What I am reading**

* The days are long but the decades are short by Sam Altman

https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short

First of all, what a great title! Second, I got impressed by Sam's ability to
articulate important topic in a succinct and easily digestible form. Third, the
advices themselves are very good.
