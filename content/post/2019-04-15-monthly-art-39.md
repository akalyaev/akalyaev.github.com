This is a monthly "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most
last month. Whether it was a full length movie, short film, music album, book
or even a painting.

**What I am watching**

* The Grammar of Happiness (2012)

Language influences how we think. In the deep jungles of Amazonia, there's a
Piraha tribe. It had been shown that there's no colors, past or future, numbers
or recursion in their native language. On one side, it limits them in terms of
scientific progress and planning (for the food shortage, for example). On the
other hand, it makes them happy. Since there's no past, there's nothing to be
sorry of. No future means less worrying about it.

Daniel Everett, the man who studied Piraha, gave a TED talk in 2017:

**What I am reading**

* [Pmarca Guide to Personal Productivity](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_personal_productivity.html)

Very useful. However, I do not agree with strategic incompetence item and think
that it should probably be used only as last resort (if it's not your job and
you don't want to do it). Otherwise, if it's your job, not doing what you're
supposed to be doing is unprofessional.

* [How to Deliver Constructive Feedback in Difficult
  Situations](https://medium.com/s/please-advise/the-essential-guide-to-difficult-conversations-41f736e63ccf)

There's a whole book on nonviolent communication called [Nonviolent
Communication: A Language of
Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71730.Nonviolent_Communication)

Before, I'd just tell a person my feelings even if this can potentially hurt
him/her. The reasons are probably my origin country and upbringing and also
egocentrism. I'm going to read a book, but even after reading the article I'm
now more aware of how words can affect people.

* [Effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/)

Just started learning about this.

The same guys, who are behind ^, have an amazing [career
guide](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/) if you're interested.
