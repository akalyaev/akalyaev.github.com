[Screw motivation what you need is discipline](http://www.wisdomination.com/screw-motivation-what-you-need-is-discipline/) ([RU](https://vc.ru/p/discipline))

**Something to think about**

“Voltaire said about God that ‘there is no God, but don’t tell that to my
servant, lest he murder me at night’. Hammurabi would have said the same about
his principle of hierarchy, and Thomas Jefferson about human rights. Homo
sapiens has no natural rights, just as spiders, hyenas and chimpanzees have no
natural rights. But don’t tell that to our servants, lest they murder us at
night.” ― Yuval Noah Harari, Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind
