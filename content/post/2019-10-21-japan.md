After being in this country for almost one month, here are three things that
shocked me the most:

<!--more-->

1. **Respect by default**. People here respect each other even if they don't
   know the person. The signs - bowing, giving something with two hands instead
   of one, being silent in public transport, etc.

2. **Attention to details**. This ranges from food packing (with a separate box
   for each ingredient) to architecture. E.g. when I visited teamLab planets in
    Tokyo, I found out that the exit is located right near the enter. Itâ€™s
    super convenient since you already know where your locker & toilet are.

3. **How clean it is**. Honestly I think now every city should remove garbage
   cans from its streets. But what should I do with the garbage? You bring it
   with you and sort it at home. Easier than you think. But requires a law &
   community efforts.

### Cities

Tokyo is cool. You can find almost anything you want. My top 3 places: teamLab
planets, Akihabara and Edo museum. Wanted to go watch sumo, but all the tickets
were sold out. Same for Ghibli Museum.

Hakone is a great place to relax with its hot springs and hiking trails.
Another thing I love is that you can stumble upon a tea house which has been
open for a few centuries and enjoy a cup of amazake or a tea.

Kyoto has a nice old town and temples, but felt too touristy to me. Geisha(s)
dance is a must thing to watch. Higashiyama Jisho-ji is the most beautiful
garden I've been to in Japan (I was in Kenrokuen - bigger, but not as
impressive).

Nara is famous for deers roaming in the city park. A lot of the cities nowadays
become too distant from nature (though some are trying to bring it back by
opening more parks, etc.). One of the biggest downsides - the smell.

Hiroshima is where I'd choose to live in Japan. Not too big, yet there's a lot
going on - festivals & different other activities. Close to Miyajima, where I'd
go when I want to be alone.

Miyajima is a village located on the small island of Itsukushima, where shops &
restaurants close at 5pm. Good hiking trails. Very calm and peaceful place
(pierce is crowded during a day though).

Shirakawa-go village is famous for its traditional gassho-zukuri farmhouses,
some of which are more than 250 years old.

### About Japanese people

I want to tell you one story. It happened to me while I was traveling from
Toyama to Takayama. I boarded a train, got into my seat and prepared myself for
a nice ride. If you ever go to these places, take the same train I did bound to
Nagoya (or a bus). Mountains, immersed in the greenery, the X river with colors
ranging from deep blue to light green and beautiful small villages will be
accompanying you during the whole trip. But back to the story. I was reading a
book, when surprisingly someone touched my shoulder. It was an older woman
wearing a white cotton sweater and blue jeans. She was smiling at me. She said
that I need to change my seat. I checked my ticket and saw that the car number
was different (8 while I was in 10th). But how did she know? So I stood up and
went to the 8th car. When I did that, she again has stopped me and tried to
explain something. I replied that I got my car wrong. Got into the correct car
now. Found my seat. A few minutes later the same woman touched my shoulder.
This time she brought a note with her. The note was saying she only wanted to
suggest I'd move closer to the window as not so many people reserve green car
(read first class) and she's sorry. She gave me a couple of small chocolate
bars. It may be hard for you to understand the Japan and it's people just from
this story, but I think it nicely shows the deep respect coupled with desire to
help.

Deep respect was one of the things that has shocked me. Why should I respect
someone whom I don't know? I asked Hiroyuki. Because everyone feel good if you
do this he responded. Could not agree more. Before I did not understand why
  Americans smile at each other ever if they might be in a bad mood. The answer
  seems to be the same. It feels good.

### Summary

A few minuses:
- everything is super expensive
- mostly sea food (I don't eat fish)

A few pluses:
- good food almost everywhere (even in supermarkets)
- super safe
- easy to travel (especially with JR pass)
- a lot of places to visit
- rich culture and history

I'd definitely recommend to visit because it's such a unique country.
