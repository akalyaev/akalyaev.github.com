This is a monthly "newsletter", containing a list of what I enjoyed the most
last month. Whether it was a full length movie, short film, music album, book
or even a painting.

**What I am watching**

* Kumaré (2011)

{{< youtube id="OXUzG6YKuvo" >}}

  - [imdb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1865425/)
  - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar%C3%A9)

"Kumaré is a 2011 documentary film directed by and starring American filmmaker
Vikram Gandhi, who poses as an Indian guru to satirize the New Age movement." -
Wikipedia

People want to believe in something. And then another guru appears who promises
to lead them to enlightenment. And in a way, the effect is achieved. People
seem to be happy, full of love and all their suffering is behind them. But it
turns out that the guru himself does not believe in what he is doing. He's a
liar. Is it possible to distinguish pseudo cult from "real"? Are there any
"real" cults at all?

**What I am reading**

* [The 13 Immutable Reads on Choosing What to Work On](https://vasilishynkarenka.com/blog/13-reads-on-choosing-what-to-work-on)

I wish this post existed earlier in my career. The amount of wisdom per
paragraph is mind blowing.

* [Exit and freedom by Nick Szabo](https://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2007/08/exit-and-freedom.html)

An old article by Nick Szabo, where he shows a relation between an "exit cost"
(ability of any citizen of a certain country to do international business) and
freedoms.

"At the other end of the spectrum from Hong Kong and Singapore are countries
with isolated populations, with poor access to world communications and travel.
Add to this countries where tax revenues can be gained from taxing agricultural
land or minerals rather than potentially mobile "human capital." These
countries tend to have the fewest freedoms."

**Stuff I found cool**

* [Fireflies](https://ncase.me/fireflies/)

> So, how do thousands of fireflies pick a leader to follow, a maestro to keep
  their flashing in time? The answer, the scientists found, is simple: They
  don't.

The example of leaderless consensus algorithm. Made by nature.

* [Blink App](https://www.blnk.app)

Finally an app with eye exercises which keeps me engaged during the process.
I think we will see a lot of similar face tracking apps soonish.
