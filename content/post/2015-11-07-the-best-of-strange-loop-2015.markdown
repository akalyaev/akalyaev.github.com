[Strange Loop](http://www.thestrangeloop.com/) is my top 5 "every year"
conferences. There were [many
videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcGKfGEEONaCIl5eU53uPBnRJ9rbIH32R)
uploaded this year. Again, kudos to organizers for them. I think, I have found
real gems for you guys. _Disclaimer: your experience may vary._
