### Articles

* [Files Are Hard](http://danluu.com/file-consistency/)
  Fantastic read! Reminded me Aphyr's series, where he shows that DBs do not
  work as intended sometimes.

* [How we’re building a system to scale for billions of requests per day](http://engineering.snapdeal.com/how-were-building-a-system-to-scale-for-billions-of-requests-per-day-201512/)
  It's good to see what people are choosing for their projects from time to
  time. Lots of advices, although some of them are only applicable if your app
  is supposed to handle tons of RPS.

* [Why Percentiles Don’t Work the Way you Think](https://www.vividcortex.com/blog/why-percentiles-dont-work-the-way-you-think)
  "There’s a big problem with most time series data and percentiles. The issue
  is that time series databases are almost always storing aggregate metrics
  over time ranges, not the full population of events that were originally
  measured."
