On my way to Warsaw took a picture of the example route from a driver, who used
to drive tourists across France.

He especially recommended to visit
[Saint-Malo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Malo) (city of privateers) and
[Pyrenees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenees).

Some sights along the route:

- Ch√¢teaux of the Loire Valley
- gorges du Tarn
- Dune of Pilat
- La Rochelle
- Cancale
- Mont Saint-Michel
