You may also find interesting [videos, which were not listed
here](https://gist.github.com/akalyaev/ac047081e479b4f4aeb6#life), but still
are my favorite (some of them are quite long).

[Prince Ea](/2016/11/prince-ea/) has something to add here too, but I don't
want to duplicate the content.

Any suggestions? Leave your comments below.
