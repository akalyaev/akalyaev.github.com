## Film - Dances with Wolves (1990)

{{< youtube id="J0obOvGGb1U" >}}

At his [recent interview][1] with Tim Ferriss, Kevin Costner said that "Dances
with Wolves" is the most beloved movie of his. And I can't agree more - it is
stunning! Despite the fact that this film is 3 hours long, I never got bored or
anything like that.
