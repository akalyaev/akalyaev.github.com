They say that life is a show. Well, for Truman Burbank, this is literally a
show, though he does not know it yet. Amazing play of Jim Carrey!

"Nike asked me to make a movie about what it means to
\#makeitcount. Instead of making their movie, I spent the
entire budget traveling around the world with my friend
Max. It took 10 days."
