Annual [Erlang Factory SF Bay Area
2016](http://www.erlang-factory.com/sfbay2016) conference ended only 3 weeks
ago. There were many great speakers and presentations. What I specifically like
about it, is that videos are available almost immediately. As usual, I am
publishing the talks, which I liked the most. Hope you'll enjoy these too.
_Disclaimer: your experience may vary._

# 1. Jamshid Mahdavi - An Erlang based Philosophy for Service Reliability 1

by Jamshid Mahdavi, WhatsApp Inc. (45 min)

{{< youtube id="tW49z8HqsNw" >}}

Great talk from the WhatsApp engineer on how they make this app so bulletproof.

# 2. A Brief History of Time

by Fred Hebert aka ferd (45 min)

{{< youtube id="WoUn2XQvGDw" >}}

An excursion into the history of different civilizations and their calendars. Fascinating!

# 3. Reactive Programming With Elixir And RethinkDB

by Peter Hamilton, RethinkDB (36 min)

{{< youtube id="6K0Tjvn6PV8" >}}

Peter talks about one of the ways to build a reliable processing pipeline which
stores intermediate results inside RethinkDB. You will need something like this
if it's undesirable to restart the whole pipeline from the beginning.

# 4. Keynote Phoenix and Elm â€“ Making the Web Functional

by Chris McCord and Evan Czaplicki (55 min)

{{< youtube id="XJ9ckqCMiKk" >}}

Feel free to skip the Elm part if you are already familiar with this language.

# 5. High Performance Erlang Pitfalls and Solutions

by MZSPEED team, MachineZone Inc. (47 min)

{{< youtube id="SPZV2h_r4U0" >}}

How would you build a fast data processing system in Erlang? The presenters
tell a story about their attempts in building one and the difficulties they
faced along the way.

Also there were 2 talks on [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), which seems interesting.

If are planning to use Kafka with Erlang, you should probably watch [this talk](https://youtu.be/FTLTbB8BlYc).
