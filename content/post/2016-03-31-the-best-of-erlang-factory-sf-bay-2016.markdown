Annual [Erlang Factory SF Bay Area
2016](http://www.erlang-factory.com/sfbay2016) conference ended only 3 weeks
ago. There were many great speakers and presentations. What I specifically like
about it, is that videos are available almost immediately. As usual, I am
publishing the talks, which I liked the most. Hope you'll enjoy these too.
_Disclaimer: your experience may vary._

Peter talks about one of the ways to build a reliable processing pipeline which
stores intermediate results inside RethinkDB. You will need something like this
if it's undesirable to restart the whole pipeline from the beginning.

How would you build a fast data processing system in Erlang? The presenters
tell a story about their attempts in building one and the difficulties they
faced along the way.

Also there were 2 talks on [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), which seems interesting.

If are planning to use Kafka with Erlang, you should probably watch [this talk](https://youtu.be/FTLTbB8BlYc).
