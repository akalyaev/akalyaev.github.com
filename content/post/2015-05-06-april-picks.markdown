### Articles

* [Highly Distributed Computations Without Synchronization](http://www.infoq.com/articles/Highly-Distributed-Computations-Without-Synchronization)

  Christopher Meiklejohn shows programming model for eventually consistent
  computations. What it basically does is ensuring that the strong convergence
  properties of individual CRDTs are preserved when we compose them in our
  program. (see video of his presentation at Erlang Factory below)

* [Debugging memory leaks in Ruby](http://samsaffron.com/archive/2015/03/31/debugging-memory-leaks-in-ruby)

  Another great post from Sam Saffron about memory leaks in Ruby. Worth reading
  for all rubyists.

* [Lessons Learned while Working on Large-Scale Server Software](http://ferd.ca/lessons-learned-while-working-on-large-scale-server-software.html)

  "Of all the lessons I've learned, there is one that can summarize them all in
  3 simple words: everything is terrible." - Fred Hebert

### Slides

Couple of really good presentations by Attendify engineers (Clojure and CLJS in production for 3 years):

* [Microservices in Clojure by Alexey Kachayev](https://speakerdeck.com/kachayev/microservices-in-clojure)

* [ClojureScript and React by Myron Mavko](https://speakerdeck.com/mmavko/clojurescript-and-react)

### Videos

* [Distributed Eventually Consistent Computations by Christopher Meiklejohn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwpakTIg9r8)

* [Everything Will Flow by Zach Tellman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bNOO3xxMc0)

  Lots of useful advices on queues, and how you need to design them, especially
  if you're planning for big load. Didn't know about Queueing Theory!
