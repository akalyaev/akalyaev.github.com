### Articles

* [Engineering Principles](https://medium.com/@treystout/engineering-principles-c58f5f8c264b)
  A very good list of the core principles every engineer should have. If your
  team doesn't have any, just take these.

### Videos

* [Add ALL the Things: Abstract Algebra Meets Analytics by Avi Bryant](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/abstract-algebra-analytics)
  Probably the best explanation of how Min-hash and HyperLogLog algorithms work (more or less).

* [From REST to CQRS with Clojure, Kafka, & Datomic by Bobby Calderwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDNPQo9UmJA)
  This is completely different comparing to what I am used to. And that's why
  this video is here. Many of the disadvantages of REST seem reasonable and
  solution, which he propose, looks very interesting.
