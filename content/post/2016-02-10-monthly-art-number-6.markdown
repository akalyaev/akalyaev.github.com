## Film - Amadeus (1984)

{{< youtube id="yIzhAKtEzY0" >}}

There were two moments in my life when I desperately wanted to listen to
classical music: after watching a brilliant [TED talk by Benjamin Zander][1] and
after watching this movie.

## Short film - Sum (2015)

{{< vimeo 144047596 >}}

â€œHow we spend our days is of course how we spend our lives." - Annie Dillard.

This is a short film based on the work of neuroscientist and writer [David Eagleman](http://www.eagleman.com/). Music and film by Temujin Doran.

## Documentary - Human (2015)

{{< youtube id="0-Retnj3TsA" >}}

This film is striking! Colorful landscapes merged with the folk music of
different peoples create amazing background for the usual people, telling
their stories and views of our world.
