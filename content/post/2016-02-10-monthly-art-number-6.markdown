There were two moments in my life when I desperately wanted to listen to
classical music: after watching a brilliant [TED talk by Benjamin Zander][1] and
after watching this movie.

This film is striking! Colorful landscapes merged with the folk music of
different peoples create amazing background for the usual people, telling
their stories and views of our world.
