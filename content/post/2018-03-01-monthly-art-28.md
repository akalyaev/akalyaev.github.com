**What I am reading**

* [A bit of life advice from Hol](https://www.facebook.com/hollybutcher90/posts/10213711745460694) [RU](https://lifehacker.ru/2018/01/18/a-bit-of-life-advice-from-hol/)

You never know when you might die, so it's important to appreciate every second
(but hard to do given everybody's thinking they are gonna live up to 70-100).

* [The Art and Science of Investing](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-art-and-science-of-investing/)

"The difference between science and art is basically this: Science often
provides multiple ways of getting something done. But if any of those ways
contradict each other, then art is playing a role."

People are quick for jumping to conclusions when in reality, nobody knows how
it will affect them in the future.
