book or even painting.

## Film - eXistenZ (1999)

{{< youtube id="HAdbdUt_h9M" >}}

Many people compare it with The Matrix (1999), what is wrong. eXistenZ tries to
show us how dangerous "full immersion" games could be. Now, when we have Oculus
Rift and similar technologies, it may be not so far we will see completely
realistic games.

## Documentary - Valley Uprising (2014)

{{< youtube id="o86TpaSBcWw" >}}

Not so long ago I've started to watch documentaries. And this movie was for me
a real boon. Very colorful, exciting, it won't let you go until the very end.
Valley Uprising tells the story of a group of young people, who do not fit into
the "standard" american life and decide to do, what they love - rock climbing.
