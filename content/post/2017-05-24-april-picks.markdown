**Quick learn**

"Go programs can have data races, resulting in unspecified behavior. Goâ€™s race
detector provides a way to find and fix such issues; but other languages
prevent races altogether, either by disallowing shared memory between Actors
(Erlang) or by requiring the programmer to indicate data ownership with types,
so the compiler can prevent races statically (Rust)."
